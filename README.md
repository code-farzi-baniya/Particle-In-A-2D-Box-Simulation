Problem we are trying to solve ? 
> Simulation and understand the wave function and probability density of the particle in the 2D Box.

Let us consider the Schrödinger Equation for an electron confined to a two dimensional box, ​ ​0<x<a and ​0<y<b​. That is to say, within this rectangle the electron wavefunction behaves as a free particle (V(x,y)=0), but the walls are impenetrable so the wavefunction ​ψ(x,y,t)=0 at the walls.
